## zephyrus-ladder

A React app for visualizing ladder data from StarCraft II.

## Functionality

The app uses conditional rendering to display the different types of information
as tabs and uses the Recharts library to render the charts.

Users can select different races and leagues to view information about using the controls with each graph.

## To Do

- Fix floating footer on smaller screens

- Alter UI in Off-Race tab to convey meaning more effectively
